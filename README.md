# Dancing Apple Tree in a Thunderstorm
## How to interact with the work.
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Click "Play / Pause" to play pr pause the music.
3. Click "music1" can switch the song to "Music 2", and click it again can switch back to "music1".
4. Move the mouse up and down to control the volume.
5. press the "space" to switch the direction of gravity(up or down).

The interface's response is as follows: 

When no buttons are clicked, apples randomly appear on the 3rd to 4th level branches. After waiting for 2 seconds, they fall down, remain stationary on the ground for 2 seconds, and then return to the tree to start the next cycle. 
If the space bar is pressed, the apple will immediately return to the branch and wait for 2 seconds before falling upwards. If the space bar is pressed again, the apple will immediately return to the branch and fall downwards after 2 seconds. 
Click the "play/pause" button to start playing music1. Click "music1" to switch the song to "music2", and vice versa to switch back to music1. When you move the mouse up in the interface, the music volume increases; when you move it down, the music volume decreases. The background color, the size of the apple, and the length of the "raindrops" will change along with the music. At this point, click the "play/pause" button to stop the music and the animation.
